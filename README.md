# Praise Monero!

The original code was created by [TheHihoGuy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheHihoGuy/).

Classic comic page that puts the photo of our great, all-powerful king fluffypony in front of Monero's official website, https://getmonero.org/.

The original website was praisemonero.org, but it's been offline for a long time (it's a scammy site now) so
I saved its source code for possible future use. I am not the creator of this source code although I have made
some minor modifications.
