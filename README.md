This code was originally deployed on praisemonero.org, but the domain expired and fell into the hands of a domain-buying bot. When the domain expired again, I managed to rescue it from digital purgatory.

I've refactored the old code and made several improvements to ensure this religious experience works flawlessly on modern browsers and mobile devices. Now everyone can praise Monero.

Original code written by [u/TheHihoGuy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/5rve3c/are_you_ready_for_a_miracle/). May their contribution to the faith be forever remembered.
